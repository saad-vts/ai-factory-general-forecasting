### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Purpose**: Collect and load data from various sources.
- **Components**:
  - Connectors for different data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, CSV files).
  - Data validation checks to ensure data quality.
  - Data transformation to standardize formats.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Forecastability
- **Purpose**: Understand the data and assess its suitability for forecasting.
- **Components**:
  - Visualization tools (e.g., time series plots, histograms).
  - Statistical tests for stationarity (e.g., ADF test).
  - Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis.
  - Seasonal decomposition.

### 3. Adding External Factors
- **Purpose**: Incorporate external variables that may influence the target variable.
- **Components**:
  - Identification of relevant external factors (e.g., economic indicators, weather data).
  - Data ingestion for external datasets.
  - Time alignment and merging of datasets.

### 4. Feature Engineering and Diagnostics
- **Purpose**: Create new features and diagnose data quality.
- **Components**:
  - Time-based features (e.g., lagged variables, rolling averages).
  - Categorical encoding for external factors.
  - Diagnostics for multicollinearity and missing values.

### 5. Feature Selection
- **Purpose**: Select the most relevant features for modeling.
- **Components**:
  - Techniques for feature importance (e.g., correlation analysis, tree-based methods).
  - Recursive feature elimination.
  - Cross-validation to assess feature subsets.

### 6. Backtesting & Model Selection
- **Purpose**: Evaluate model performance using historical data.
- **Components**:
  - Train-test split strategies (e.g., time-based splits).
  - Backtesting frameworks to simulate forecasting.
  - Comparison of different forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, machine learning models).

### 7. Error Metric Selection
- **Purpose**: Choose appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **Components**:
  - Implementations of various error metrics:
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    - Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE)
    - Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE)
    - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Visualization of error metrics for comparison.

### 8. Confidence Intervals & Horizon Control
- **Purpose**: Provide uncertainty estimates for forecasts.
- **Components**:
  - Calculation of confidence intervals for point forecasts.
  - Horizon control mechanisms to adjust forecast horizons dynamically.

### 9. Monitoring & Drift Detection
- **Purpose**: Continuously monitor model performance and detect data drift.
- **Components**:
  - Real-time monitoring dashboards.
  - Statistical tests for drift detection (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
  - Alerts for significant performance degradation.

### 10. Outputs & Governance
- **Purpose**: Ensure transparency and governance of the forecasting process.
- **Components**:
  - Documentation of model assumptions and decisions.
  - Version control for models and datasets.
  - Reporting tools for stakeholders (e.g., dashboards, reports).

### Implementation Considerations
- **Technology Stack**: Choose appropriate tools and libraries (e.g., Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
- **Collaboration**: Ensure that each module can be developed and maintained independently, allowing for collaboration among team members.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for each module to ensure reliability and correctness.

This modular approach allows for flexibility in development and maintenance, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements or incorporate new techniques as they emerge. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, facilitating a more agile workflow.
